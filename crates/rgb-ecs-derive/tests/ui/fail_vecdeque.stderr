error: Component field uses forbidden type `VecDeque`.

       VecDeque<T> is not allowed in components. Use relations instead:
       - Each queue item becomes an entity with a relation
       - Add a sequence/priority field for ordering
       - Example: world.spawn((Packet { seq: 1, data }, Pair::<PendingFor>(connection)))
       - Or mark this component as #[component(opaque)] if it's a runtime-only handle

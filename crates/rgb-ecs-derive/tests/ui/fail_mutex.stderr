error: Component field uses forbidden type `Mutex`.

       Mutex<T> is not allowed in components. ECS handles synchronization.
       - Components are accessed via the World, which provides proper synchronization
       - For shared mutable state, use the WORLD entity or relations
       - Or mark this component as #[component(opaque)] if it's a runtime-only handle

error: Component field uses forbidden type `Box`.

       Box<T> is not allowed in components. Use flat data or relations instead.
       - If T is large, consider if it should be multiple smaller components
       - If T is a trait object, use entity relations with marker components
       - Or mark this component as #[component(opaque)] if it's a runtime-only handle

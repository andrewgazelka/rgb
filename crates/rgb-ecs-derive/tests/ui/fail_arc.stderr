error: Component field uses forbidden type `Arc`.

       Arc<T> is not allowed in components. Reference counting breaks owned-value semantics.
       - Use entity references (Entity) instead of Arc
       - Store shared data on a separate entity and reference it via relation
       - Or mark this component as #[component(opaque)] if it's a runtime-only handle

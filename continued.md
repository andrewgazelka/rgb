is there anything that is better that u can do? look at evenio and flecs architecture? if there is add and repeat


# TODO

- we should have the notion of Modules in our ECS similar to bevy/flecs btw so we can have many separte cates that we all include; do we have this... can we?
- add AttackModule
- add CommandMoudle (that allows improting clap as a command in Minecraft make sure Minecraft will send proper command tree based on this / etc)
- add command that allows for reading the state of a given entity and prints (minecraft command) like all the components
- add command that allows for reading the HISTORY state of a given (entity, componentId) similar to flecs query 
- add in-depth miri tests
- add in-depth integration tests
- compare how we are doing regions,grouping with how flecs does group-by and how others might and determine the most efficient way to do the RGB stuff given that players / etc might move between regions often
- do a bit if tango benchmarking

# Things added
